1. INTRODUCTION

Hello and thank you for your interest in Scheme Power Tools!

Scheme Power Tools is a collection of Scheme utilities developed
since spring 2010, when I took MIT's 6.945: Adventures in Advanced Symbolic 
Programming.

Scheme Power Tools was developed and tested with MIT Scheme. It might work
with other Schemes, but your mileage may vary. For instructions on how
to get started with MIT Scheme, you are welcome to read

2. LOADING

To start using Scheme Power Tools, just load the file scheme-tools.scm:
